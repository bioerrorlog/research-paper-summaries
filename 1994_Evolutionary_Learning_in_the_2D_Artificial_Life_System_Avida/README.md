# Evolutionary Learning in the 2D Artificial Life System "Avida"
<!-- Author, year and journal infomations. -->
Chris Adami and C. Titus Brown

Artificial Life IV, 1994

## Motivation
<!-- What issues or problems did they try to solve? -->
<!-- What was lacking in existing research? -->
Tom RayのTierraによって、コンピュータ上でのopen-endな進化の再現が可能であることが示された。
しかし、より大規模で高速な進化システムを構築するには、Tierraの非局所的相互作用のデザインには課題がある。
## Method
<!-- ![fig1](img/fig1.png) -->
<!-- What system did they create? Why did they think that the system design was well jusified? -->
<!-- What algorithm did they create? Why did they consider that the algorithm design was good enough? -->
<!-- What kind of surveys did they do? How did they justify their study design? -->
<!-- What experiments did they conduct? How did they justify their experimenal design? -->
Avidaを開発した.

AvidaがTierraと違うところ
- 2Dセルオートマトンの要素  
-> 局所的相互作用、空間配置の影響
- マルチノードで実行可能なシンプルな設計

AvidaがTierraと同じところ
- 機械語様の命令セットを使うところ
- 仮想マシン上で実行させるところ
## Insight
<!-- What results did they obtain? Under what conditions did it work, and under what conditions did it not work? -->
<!-- What are the new findings? What are the findings that could be used in other applications or systems? -->
局所的相互作用性は、遺伝型の多様な進化を引き起こす,
## Unknown
<!-- What is still unknown or unresolved? -->

Avidaの応用性.
ユーザー指定タスク、進化、生態学、免疫学への研究に応用できるかも.
